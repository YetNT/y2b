<h1 align="center"> The official discord.js remake of Yet 2.0! (previously aoi.js)</h1>

<br>

## _Currently still adding the rest of the commands from the aoi.js to discord.js move._

# Commands

**[Commands](https://y2b.pages.dev/commands)**

# Contributions

I probably will not allow contributions to be made, this is a one man bot and it will stay that way. But suggestions to code fixes and improvements are helpful, and cannot be left unnoticed (Your name will be in the README.md)

# Cloning

`git cloe https://github.com/Yetity/y2b`

## Pre-files

Files that i do not push i reccommend you do not either (if your bot will have an open repository)

`node_modules`

`.env`

`promocodes.json` (just to hide the promocodes)

## Database

### Connecting

If you haven't noticed, I use MongoDB.

After the sign up process and DB creation, go to `.env` and add

```
MONGODB_URI = your_mongodb_connection_uri
```

### Models

Models are already defined so don't worry about that :+1:
(Of course you can change it to your liking)

## Emojis

In `src/utils/beatify.js` is where you can find and edit the coin emoji and

In `src/utils/items/items.json` is where you can edit every individual emoji per item.

## Post-files

Assuming you actually cloned this and saw how rigged my code is,

Best of luck! - Yet#0447
